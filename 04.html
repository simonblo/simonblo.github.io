				In this project I wanted to learn more about game development and rendering in
				Unity. I wanted to gain more experience and understanding in the process of
				modeling and texturing. On top of that I also wanted to gain more experience in
				building game levels with the features that an advanced game engine can offer.

				The full project was done in a group of 6 people. It represents a virtual reality
				game called <a href="https://agigroup8.github.io/Shooter/">Shooter: Unknown</a>
				where you need to shoot your way through a secret facility full of shooting
				enemies. It was implemented with C# and Unity. All of the work that I show on this
				page represents my own independent work.

				My first task was to model a pistol in Maya based on reference images of a Smith &
				Wesson 1911. I wanted to add extra details to the pistol since it is so close to
				the player. I also wanted to model the frame, slide and hammer as separate parts in
				order to support animation. For the UV-mapping I focused on minimizing texture
				distortions and hiding as many seams as possible. The resulting model consists of
				3318 triangles:

				The texturing was done in Substance 3D Painter where I tried to add a lot of
				interesting details:

				I also created a recoil animation in Unity. This was done by defining the
				transformation for each moving part of the pistol at different key frames. All of
				the other frames in the animation are then computed automatically based on
				interpolation. To allow the player to interact with the pistol I also implemented
				some game logic for shooting and reloading which in turn plays the animation when
				the trigger is pressed:

				My next task was to create some objects for the game level. In order to make the
				gameplay more interesting the game level needed some cover to hide behind. The game
				level also needed some light sources and I did not want to place invisible light
				sources. Based on that I decided to create a wooden crate, a steel barrel and a
				roof panel light. The idea behind the steel barrel was that it could either serve
				as regular cover but also be extended into an explosive object later if there was
				enough time.

				The modeling was done in Maya where I tried to balance the detail level with the
				polygon count:

				My next task was to build the actual game level. It was supposed to represent an
				indoor storage area and for that I needed rooms and corridors. I decided to build a
				modular wall system consisting of a flat middle section with an inner corner
				section and an outer corner section. These sections could then be combined into a
				full level directly in Unity. The idea was to make it easy to quickly modify or
				expand the game level depending on project needs. My strategy when creating the
				sections was to first create a single brick tile. Then I connected multiple tiles
				into one row and then I connected multiple rows into one surface.

				My final task was to combine all individual components into a complete game level.
				First I created the basic shape of the level by just combining wall sections. I
				wanted to create the feeling of moving through the level rather than staying in one
				single room. Then I tried to make the level more interesting by adding some cover
				and firing positions. After that I started to improve the visual quality of the
				level by adding light sources and shadows. I tweaked the rendering settings in
				Unity and changed into deferred rendering to allow more light sources while also
				adjusting the maximum range of the light sources to improve performance.
