				In this project I wanted to learn more about game development and rendering in
				Unity. I wanted to learn the process of modeling and texturing with software used
				in the game industry. On top of that I also wanted to gain more experience in
				building game levels with the features that an advanced game engine can offer.
			</div>
			<div class="textbox">
				The full project was done in a group of 6 people. It represents a virtual reality
				game called <a href="https://agigroup8.github.io/">Light In The Dark</a> where you
				need to defend yourself and hold your ground in a dark mysterious mine. It was
				implemented with C# and Unity. All of the work that I show on this page represents
				my own independent work.

				First I wanted to explore some of the industry-standard software for modeling and
				texturing. After searching I decided to explore Maya, ZBrush and Substance 3D
				Painter. My primary focus was to learn the basics and to understand the workflow.
				In Maya I learned some of the basic tools for modeling and UV-mapping. In ZBrush I
				learned to use different brushes combined with masking and subdivision. In
				Substance 3D Painter I learned to use material channels, noise textures and decal
				projections. The resulting output from this initial task was not intended to be
				used in the actual project but rather as a showcase of my learning:

				My next task was to create the game level which was supposed to represent a dark
				underground mine.
			</div>
			<div class="textbox">
				I needed some game objects that could be placed in the underground environment in
				order to make it feel more interesting. In addition to that I also wanted some
				natural way of visualizing the available playing area for the player in virtual
				reality. Based on that I decided to create a modular mine railway system consisting
				of a turning platform together with one straight rail segment and one curved rail
				segment.
			</div>
			<div class="textbox">
				The modeling was done in Maya where I tried to balance the detail level with the
				polygon count:

			</div>

				The UV-mapping was done in Maya where I tried to minimize texture distortions and
				hide seams:

				The texturing was done in Substance 3D Painter where I tried to add a lot of
				interesting details:

			</div>
			<div class="textbox">
				I also needed to create the actual mine and I decided to do this with individual
				rock panels for the walls and roof which could then be combined into an enclosed
				mine directly in Unity. I created these panels in ZBrush by using procedural
				surface noise to displace the points on a high resolution plane. Then I used
				Decimation Master to reduce the polygon count followed by UV Master to
				automatically generate UV coordinates.

			<div class="textbox">
				The first image represents the wall panel while the second image represents the
				roof panel:

			</div>
			<div class="textbox">
				I also wanted to make the game level feel larger and more mysterious. To achieve
				that I only used dynamic light sources without any static light sources. In
				addition to that I also decided to add railway tunnels in each direction of the
				mine. This would also make light effects more interesting since light sources could
				travel into the tunnels. To mask the panel edges at tunnel entries I decided to
				create a wooden support structure.

				The modeling and UV-mapping was done in Maya while the texturing was done in
				Substance 3D Painter:

			</div>
			<div class="textbox">
				I used the wall panel and the wooden support structure to build two larger wall
				modules. Both of the two wall modules were built as prefabs directly in Unity and
				the idea was to interleave the modules in order to obtain the circular shape of the
				mine. The first wall module represents one quadrant of the circular shape while the
				second wall module represents the intersecting railway tunnel entry between each
				quadrant:

				<a href="images/05-18.png" style="grid-area: 1 / 1 / 5 /  9;"><img src="images/05-18.png"></a>
				<a href="images/05-19.png" style="grid-area: 1 / 9 / 5 / 13;"><img src="images/05-19.png"></a>
			</div>
			<div class="textbox">
				With all the individual parts ready I continued my task on building the game level.
				I created a flat terrain and then removed the default ambient and directional light
				in the scene. The platform was placed at the center of the scene and combined with
				the other rail segments into a larger rail system. After that I also combined the
				different wall modules into an enclosed circular mine and placed the large roof
				panel on top.
			</div>
			<div class="textbox">
				My final task was to improve the visual quality of the level by adjusting the
				rendering settings in Unity. I did this by adding x8 multisample anti-aliasing
				together with real-time soft shadows. I also adjusted the settings for the
				various light sources and tweaked the ranges for the cascaded shadow maps. The
				first image shows the rendering before the changes and the second image shows the
				rendering after the changes:

				This is the final result of the game level showing the player area and one of the
				tunnel entries:
