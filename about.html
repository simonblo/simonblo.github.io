				I have a great passion for computer graphics and game development. In particular I
				really enjoy to push the boundaries of visual quality and to create breathtaking
				stories through interactive experiences. One area that I'm specifically interested
				about at the moment is real-time ray tracing and various techniques to improve its
				performance. Apart from that I'm interested in most areas of rendering where I can
				contribute towards making new breakthroughs and shaping the state-of-the-art and
				technologies of the future.
